A mischievous Python calculator that calls you stupid for easy or invalid inputs 😂.


# Rude Calc

Rude Calc is a simple Python calculator with a mischievous twist 😁.  
Perform **basic calculations** — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — and watch it playfully **call you stupid** in certain situations.

## Features

- Performs **addition (+)**, **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (*)**, and **division (/)**.
- User-friendly **input prompts**.
- If you **input a very easy calculation**, like `1 + 1`, it will tease you by calling you stupid 😂.
- If you **type a nonsensical operator or something that's not a number**, it will also call you stupid 😁.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rude-calc.git
```

2. **Navigate into directory:**

```bash
cd rude-calc
```

## Usage

```bash
python rude-calc.py
```

- The script will prompt you for an operator and two numbers.
- If you enter something ridiculous (like an invalid operator or an easy sum), it will respond by calling you stupid.

## Future Improvement Ideas

- Handle division by zero gracefully.
- Support more operations (like exponentiation).
- Expand the range of mischievous responses.
